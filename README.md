# Cowin-slots-availability-notification-app-on-desktop
# A desktop notification app notifying the number and type  of vaccine available and location of the slots in your own district
I have been facing  lots of issues while finding the vaccine slot for me and my relatives. I couldn't find an empty slot and this made me to write a python script for the same

Finally, I wrote a python script using simple python modules and this script will make a notification sound as well as appear as a pop-up  on your desktop in every 15 minutes about the availability of slots,no of slots as well as the type of vaccine given in your city/district. Hopefully I will now not find any difficulty in booking slots for dose 2.

Spreading this as much as possible, as it might help  in booking a slot for loved ones. And soon, India can become a covid free nation.
