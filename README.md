# Cowin-slots-availability-notification-app-on-desktop
# A desktop notification app notifying the number and type  of vaccine available and location of the slots in your own district
I have been facing  lots of issues while finding the vaccine slot for me and my relatives. I couldn't find an empty slot and this made me to write a python script for the same

Finally, I wrote a python script using simple python modules and this script will make a notification sound as well as notify you on your desktop in every 15 minutes about the availability of slots,no of slots as well as the type of vaccine given you city/district. Hopefully I will now not find any difficulty in booking slots for dose 2.

Spreading this as much as possible, as it might help  in booking a slot for loved ones. And soon, India can become a covid free nation.
